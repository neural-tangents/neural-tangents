  amount of information being tracked compared to the other options, i.e.,
  the information tracked by `OVER_PIXELS` is a strict subset of that tracked
  by `OVER_POINTS`, which itself tracks a strict subset of information
  compared to the `NO` option. Note that this is an `IntEnum`
  meaning that comparison operators `<`, `==` work as set inclusion and equality
  (and `>`, `<=`, `>=` as would be expected given this definition).

  Attributes:
    var1: variances of the first batch of inputs. A `np.ndarray` with shape

      specified by the `marginal` argument for CNNs with `batch_size_1` for data
      dimension(s).
    nngp: covariance between the first and second input (NNGP). A `np.ndarray`
      of shape `[batch_size_1, batch_size_2]` for fully-connected networks, or
      matching the one specifed by the `cross` argument for CNNs with
      `[batch_size_1, batch_size_2]` for data dimensions.
    var2: optional variances of the second batch of inputs. A `np.ndarray` with
      shape `[batch_size_2]` for fully-connected networks or matching the one
      specified by the `marginal` argument for CNNs with `batch_size_2` for data
      dimension(s).
    ntk: the neural tangent kernel (NTK). `np.ndarray` of same shape as `nngp`.
    is_gaussian: a boolean, specifying whether the output features or channels
      of the layer / NN function (returning this `Kernel` as the `kernel_fn`)
      are i.i.d. Gaussian with covariance `nngp`, conditioned on fixed inputs to
      the layer and i.i.d. Gaussian weights and biases of the layer. For
      example, passing an input through a CNN layer with i.i.d. Gaussian weights
      and biases produces i.i.d. Gaussian random variables along the channel
      dimension, while passing an input through a nonlinearity does not.
    is_height_width: a boolean specifying whether the covariance matrices
      `nngp`, `var1`, `var2`, and `ntk` have `height` dimensions preceding
      `width` or the other way around. Is always set to `True` if `nngp` and
      `ntk` are less than 6-dimensional and alternates between consecutive CNN
      layers otherwise to avoid self-cancelling transpositions.
    marginal: an instance of `Marginalisation` enum or its ID, specifying types
      of covariances between spatial dimensions tracked in `var1`/`var2`.
    cross: an instance of `Marginalisation` enum or its ID, specifying types of
      covariances between spatial dimensions tracked in `nngp`/`ntk`.
    shape1: a tuple specifying the shape of the random variable in the first
      batch of inputs. These have variance `var1` and covariance with the second
      batch of inputs given by `nngp`.
